# Hunter-Searcher

A small search engine written in rust.

Comes with a crawler. (so far, very in development at the moment)

## TODO

- write a better web interface using `include_str!()` macro
- about page(s) + footer with info

## Wishlist

- crawling local files (?)
- maybe multi-threaded crawling?
- 

Name inspired from the little drones in Dune by Frank Herbert.
